# XPath Tools 2022
A Visual Studio Extension which can run any XPath and XPath function; navigates through results at the click of a button. Can show and copy any XPath incl. XML namespaces, avoiding XML namespace induced headaches. Keeps track of the current XPath via the statusbar.

A special thanks to [Uli Weltersbach](https://github.com/uli-weltersbach) for his work on the original extension. This repo is a clone of the VS 2019 version of the extension upgraded to VS 2022.
